In this lab, we use a EC2 autoscaling group with Wordpress application running, and sitting in VPC. We leverage the VPC stack in the lab Automated Deployment of VPC with the default parameters and recommended stack name. 

### 1.1 Setup the VPC Stack

Please download the latest version of the CloudFormation template here: [vpc-alb-app-db.yaml](/Common/Create_VPC_Stack/Code/vpc-alb-app-db.yaml) and setup VPC stack name as **WebApp1-VPC**
or reference to [Create VPC Stack](/security/200_labs/200_automated_deployment_of_vpc/1_create_vpc_stack/)

### 1.2 Setup the Application Services Stack

1.  Use the latest version CloudFormation template and download to your computer, or by cloning this repository: [200-ops-wordpress-fis.yaml](/Operations/200_Anticipate_failure_with_fault_injection_simulator/Code/200-ops-wordpress-fis.yaml) to create a WordPress site, with an provisioned RDS database, and pre-defined tag for Fault Injection Simulation experiemnt.

    In order to have better alignment for followin steps, please setup App stack name as **WebApp1-Wordress**

2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, select your preferred region, and open the CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ . Note if your CloudFormation console does not look the same, you can enable the redesigned console by clicking New Console in the CloudFormation menu.

3. Click **Create Stack**, then **With new resources (standard)**.

5. Choose the CloudFormation template you downloaded in [**Step 1.1**](#11-setup-the-vpc-stack), return to the CloudFormation console page and click Next.
Enter the following details:
Stack name: **WebApp1-WordPress**

6. Review the information for the stack. When youâ€™re satisfied with the configuration, check I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names then click Create stack.

7. After the stack status change to **CREATE_COMPLETE**, you can find the *WebsiteURL* value from *Outputs tab* in your web browser, this is how to access what you just created.
